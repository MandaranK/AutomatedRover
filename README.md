# Automated Rover
Designed and programmed to travel along a path from one location to another.
If the rover drives out of the pathway, it is able to relocate the pathway automatically.
The outer structure is 3D printed, with Analog Line Sensors, DC Motors, and Arduino.
Line sensors and motors on the wheels are programmed for automation through the Arduino, in C using the Arduino IDE.
